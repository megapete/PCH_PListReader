// These routines are used to convert the "endian-ness" of numerical representations. In particular, they convert between Big-endian representations and whatever representation the host computer uses.
// NOTE: This file will grow as I require these weirdo routines. For now, only Big-Endian routines are included (Little-endian routines will only be added if I need them for something). The intention is to have a cross-platform method of calling the routines.
